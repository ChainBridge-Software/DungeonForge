# DungeonForge

<p>DungeonForge is a platforming bullet-hell game set in a seemingly innocent medieval town.</p>
<p>This is the first prototype of a much bigger project!<br>In this demo the following things work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platformer Movement</li>
<li>Enemy logic</li>
<li>Death and respawning</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are still lots of features missing. Stay tuned for the final game - it's going to be phenomenal ;)</p>
